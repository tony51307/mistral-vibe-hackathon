    When subprocess and pipe transports (e.g. stdio MCP servers) are garbage
    collected after their event loop has already closed, their ``__del__``
    builds a ``repr`` that reads a now-closed pipe's file descriptor and raises
    ``ValueError("I/O operation on closed pipe")``. The interpreter merely
    *ignores* the exception, yet still prints the full traceback to stderr,
    which is alarming on a clean ``/exit``. This wraps the offending ``__del__``
    methods to drop that error. No-op off Windows; safe to call more than once.
